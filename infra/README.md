# AWS deployment setup

The deploy workflow uses GitHub OIDC, so it does not store AWS access keys. The one-time setup requires local AWS credentials with permission to bootstrap CDK and create the deploy role.

1. Bootstrap the target account and region with `bunx cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT_ID/us-east-1`.
2. Get the warefeats org's numeric ID: `gh api orgs/warefeats -q .id`.
3. Create the GitHub OIDC role: `GITHUB_ORG_ID=<id-from-step-2> just setup-oidc`, or manually: `aws cloudformation deploy --template-file infra/github-oidc-role.yml --stack-name warefeats-github-oidc --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides GitHubOrg=warefeats GitHubRepository=warefeats.com GitHubOrgId=<id> GitHubRepositoryId=1346850977`.
4. Read the role ARN with `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name warefeats-github-oidc --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='RoleArn'].OutputValue" --output text`.
5. Save that ARN as the repository Actions secret `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN` and set the optional Actions variable `AWS_REGION` if the target is not `us-east-1`.

If the AWS account already has a GitHub Actions OIDC provider, pass `ExistingOidcProviderArn=arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:oidc-provider/token.actions.githubusercontent.com` in step 3.

After any repository transfer (e.g. changing the GitHub org), the OIDC role must be re-deployed because the owner ID in the immutable ID-form subject claim changes. Get the new org ID and re-run `just setup-oidc` with the updated `GITHUB_ORG_ID`.

The hosting bucket is private, versioned, encrypted, and retained if the stack is deleted. CloudFront is the only public origin path, and its viewer-request function gives every page one URL: `www.warefeats.com` and page paths without a trailing slash redirect (301) to the canonical URL. A push to `main` runs checks and tests, deploys the stack, uploads the static build, and invalidates the distribution.
